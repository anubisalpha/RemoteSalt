==========

With Security in the forefront of peoples mind, most sites use a salted hash password storage solution where a user can only be authenticated if the correct password is used and the correct salted Hash.

The only weakness in this solution is if someone breaks in and retreve both it is possible to decrypt the password thus allowing access.

The only way to increase security is if the site employs a spread wide approach and seperate each element of the authentication.
